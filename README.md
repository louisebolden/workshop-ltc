# Learning to Code vs Coding at Work

A collection of examples/exercises to go along with my workshop, which is aimed at newly self-taught coders or recent bootcamp grads curious about the difference coding to learn vs coding at work.

This workshop is ideally interactive and discussion-based, and lead by two software developers with a few years' experience to share.

Topics covered:

1. GitHub + collaborative workflows
2. Automated test suites
3. Continuous integration
4. Separate apps (backend API + frontend web/mobile) and/or microservices
5. Frontend frameworks like React, Vue, + many more
6. Build tools like Webpack
7. Web services like AWS, Google Cloud, + many more

Goals:

* share our experiences of learning to code vs coding at work
* check out some examples of how web & mobile application projects can be worked on in companies
* discuss your questions & concerns about your first dev job
