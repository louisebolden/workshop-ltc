# Learning to Code vs Coding at Work

## Demo/Example 5: Frontend Frameworks

For this example, let's use `create-react-app` to take a look at one of the popular frontend frameworks.

### Learn & Do

1. Check out the GitHub repo for create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), to get an overview of what this project is and what it can be useful for
2. When you're ready, run `npx create-react-app .` to turn this directory into a brand new React app
3. Notice that command results in this README.md file being renamed README.old.md - not an issue, just know where to find these instructions if you need them (and do look at the new README.md to see the create-react-app instructions)
4. Run `npm start` to start running your new React app
5. As the app's homescreen says, you can edit `./example-5/src/App.js` to make changes to this app - and it'll reload on save - so go ahead and change the background colour and find a new SVG image to replace `./example-5/src/logo.svg` with
6. Take a look at `./example-5/src/App.test.js` and review the new README file to find the instructions for running this test - does it still pass after the changes you made in the previous step? If so, can you break it? If not, can you fix it?
7. Take a look at `./example-5/src/serviceWorker.js` and see whether you can follow the comments in there to enable the service worker - what are the key pros & cons of doing so?

#### Further Learning/Practice

If you want to work on bigger React apps in future, you'll probably want to learn [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) or similar if you haven't already.
